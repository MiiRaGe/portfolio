    {{#> case/paragraphe title="The challenge" }}
        <p>When I joined H&M in 2018, a big overhaul of the H&M loyalty program was underway, aiming to increase
            engagement and member satisfaction,
            decrease calls to customer service,
            and grow the membership base.</p>

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="My role" }}
        <p><strong>UX Designer</strong>, working on several "cases" with different teams (Business Solution Analysts, IT
            Architects, UI
            Designers, etc.). I worked on making it easier to use rewards, offering new benefits (like payment with
            Klarna) and ways to earn
            points.

        <p><strong>Conversation with Customers Service about the membership
            decreased</strong> thanks to our efforts to improve usability (in the first month after launch: 7% of all
            contacts, down from 10%. Over time, membership dropped out off the top 10 main reasons for contacts
            completely).</p>
        <p><strong>+21% of members use rewards</strong> every time they shop or every other time, as we made it possible
            to apply rewards easily at different stages in users' journeys. </p>
        <p><strong>On mobile, about half of customers use the Klarna payment methods</strong> we introduced, and it
            drove up conversions.</p>

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="The process" }}
        <p>We were working in a waterfall environment, and when I joined H&M, discovery, requirements and analysis had
            already been completed.</p>

        <p>Below
            are two examples of cases I worked on.</p>
    {{/case/paragraphe}}


    {{#> case/twoColumn }}
        {{#> case/leftColumn title="Rewards" img="img/hm2_testtill.jpg"
                             alt="In a store, a test participant seems unsure how to scan their membership QR code from the H&M app" }}

        {{/case/leftColumn}}
        {{#> case/rightColumn}}
            <h4>The problem: "Okay... How do I use this?"</h4>
            <p>Usage of rewards was low. Previous research had shown that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>users had no idea how to use their offers online,</li>
                <li>staff was spending a lot of time helping customers with rewards in stores.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Design, test, iterate</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Rewards page</strong> was a big source of confusion and frustration for users: it had a
                    button to use the offer in store, but just text about how to use it online.
                    I tested having a button to use in store, but participants were
                    unsure what to expect when clicking the
                    new button. I had to tweak the copy and the design
                    of the confirmation message several times.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Error messages</strong>: I mapped out error cases with Analyst and Architects. We realised
                    there were more technical
                    limitations and complex business
                    rules than expected: offers that cannot be combined, maximum discount reached, etc.
                    Providing precise error messages, like I had planned,
                    would have impacted load times too much in the shopping bag. To balance that out, I made sure
                    the process was forgiving (offers can be used again if they did not result in discounts).


                </li>
                <li><strong>In store experience</strong>:
                    Technical limitations kept piling up when we were exploring how to provide an easier experience in
                    store.
                    At some point, we had to acknowledge that we had scoped out so much of our solution that
                    it was not solving any of users' problems anymore. So we made the decision to leave this out
                    of the release. But we knew the systems
                    would change soon, so that in the near future we could give it another go!

                possible to access the terms and conditions of each offer to figure out why it does not work
                (information icon), and in the worst case scenario, offers are not "burned" after checkout
                and can be used again if they did not result in discounts.

            <h4>The brief from business stakeholders</h4>
            <p>H&M wanted to introduce a new benefit for members: monthly invoices with Klarna. My job was to find how
                to make that fit into the existing
                <em>Pay later</em> section under <em>My Account</em>, and to
                provide helpful reminders when time came to pay the invoices.
            </p>
            <h4>Design, test, iterate</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Finding and paying invoices</strong>: The biggest challenge was to fit everything into one
                    page. My first idea
                    was to provide two tabs:
                    one for <em>Pay in XX days</em>, and the other one for <em>Monthly invoices</em>. But it became
                    clear
                    in user testing that the distinction between the two methods was irrelevant to users.
                    What matters: what still needs to be paid, and what has already been paid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Notifications</strong>: To encourage customers to pay in time, from the H&M app (not from
                    the Klarna app), it had been decided that we would send push notifications about due invoices.
                    The problem? H&M
                    already sent a lot of notifications! <!--Research suggested few new users would turn on push
                    notifications unless we allowed them to choose what to opt-in for, and for those who did receive
                    notifications, reminders to pay invoices would be lost among marketing messages.-->
                    I tried to push to send less notifications overall, and to allow users to choose what types of
                    messages to opt-in for. But
                    I did not manage to get all stakeholders to agree in time for that release. We did however
                    launch
                    a wider initiative around the quality and quantity of our communications to customers.
                    And for that release, I focused on highlighting things to pay within the interface instead, for
                    instance through badges and
                    an inbox for personal
                    communications in <em>My Account</em>.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Main changes: the 2 tabs changed from <em>Individual

                Invoices for each month are not displayed on a separate view anymore.

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="Wrapping up" }}
        <p>The results of the Loyalty program re-design were overall positive, but there were a few missed
            opportunities.

            For instance, focus during the re-design was on making things easier for members themselves, but we failed
            to address the needs
            of staff working on the Loyalty program in different markets. As a result, they use workarounds: for
            instance, they put up announcements about the Loyalty program on site by using the Rewards page template.
            So, in some countries, the <em>Rewards</em> section contains more news than offers, and the perceived
            relevance of rewards has gone down.

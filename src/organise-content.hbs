        <p>Improve the Accommodation pages of the <a href="https://www.thomascook.com/">Thomas Cook</a>
            website, which contain detailed information about the hotel, possible flights and board basis options.
        The goal? Increase progression to the next step of the booking journey and decrease contacts to
        Customer Service.</p>

            <h4>Review quantitative data</h4>
            <p>I worked closely with the Analyst in the team to review data from customer service,
                and interactions recorded in <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>.
            </p>

            <h4>User testing</h4>

            <p>I conducted remote unmoderated user
                testing on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">Usertesting.com</a> to quickly dig deeper into why some issues occurred. The main takeaways were that:
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>some buttons were hard to discover</li>
                <li>some content wasn't where users expected it to be.</li>
                <li>several section names sounded similar, which made it difficult to know what content to
                    expect in each section.
                </li>
                <li>the structure was too deep: after expanding a few subsections without finding what they
                    were looking for, users just gave up.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Workshop</h4>
            <p>A workshop was led by the Product Owner and Design Lead. I presented an overview of
            all the issues encountered on the Accommodation page.</p>
            <p>At the end of the workshop, we had a prioritised list of opportunities to act on. High up the list
            was re-organising the content on the page, and increasing affordance for key features.</p>

               <h4>Card Sorting</h4>

               <p>I organised a card sorting exercise on <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal Workshop</a> to find out how users naturally group the content
                and name the sections.</p>
            <p>The results?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A couple of sections of the page weren't groups users naturally thought of.
                </li>
                <li>Users chose section names that are more descriptive and shorter than existing ones.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I presented these results to the team. There were some surprises, but we still managed to
                agree on a new way to organise
                the content that we believed would work better.</p>

            <h4>Tree Testing</h4>

            <p>We needed to validate our proposition before changing thousands of product pages. There
                wasn't much buy-in in sister companies in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands: they felt some things
                would work only in English. So
                I got help from colleagues there to set up similar tests in German, French and Dutch.</p>
            <p>The results helped
                to validate the changes by showing that with the new tree, users can find the information
                that was difficult to find before, and it takes them less time to get there.
            </p>
                <h4>Re-design and validate</h4>
               <p>In some cases, we had to change the design along with moving content to a different location on the page. This
                   was for instance the case with the videos of hotels. In those case, I proposed solutions,
                   discussed them with the designer and developers, then ran usability test to validate our ideas.

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="Results" }}
           <ul>
            <li>Content got organised in sections that reflect what our users are looking for.</li>
            <li>Section names are short and describe exactly what each section contains, in users' own
                words.
            </li>
            <li>The structure is more flat: 2 levels of headings instead of 4.</li>
        </ul>

           <p>Changes gradually rolled out. Good results. For instance, room and board type led to conversion up by 3.5%</p>
           <p>349% icrease in users engaging with vidios (good as associated conversion rate is the highest of all clickable elements on the page)</p>

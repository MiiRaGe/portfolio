            <h4>Research questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Why do we have so many contacts to customer service about this page?</li>
                <li>What information are users missing to make their decision?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Methodologies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review quantitative data</strong> from customer service and <a
                        href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a> to identify issues,
                </li>
                <li><strong>Remote unmoderated usability
                    testing</strong> on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">Usertesting.com</a> to dig deeper into
                    why some issues
                    occurred.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Main findings</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>some buttons were hard to discover.</li>
                <li>some content wasn't where users expected it to be.</li>
                <li>it was hard to know what content to
                    expect in a section based on its name.
                </li>
                <li>the structure was too deep: after expanding a few subsections without finding what they
                    were looking for, users just gave up.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Workshop</h4>
            <p>A workshop was led by the Product Owner and Design Lead. I presented an overview of
                all the issues encountered on the Accommodation page.
                The outcome? A prioritised list of opportunities to act on, starting with <strong>re-organising the
                    content of the page, and increasing affordance for key features.</strong></p>

            <h4>Card Sorting</h4>

            <p>I organised a card sorting exercise on <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal Workshop</a> to
                find out how users naturally group the content
                and name the sections.</p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>A couple of sections of the page weren't groups users naturally thought of, and users chose
                section names that are more descriptive and shorter than the existing ones.</p>
            I presented these results to the team. There were surprises, but we managed to
            agree on a new structure to test. Some of our proposed changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Remove the <em>Your Hotel</em> section</strong>, which had subsections about
                    activities and food.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Merge some sections</strong> (for instance: <em>More Flights Options</em> + <em>Your Flight
                    Details</em> = <em>Flights
                    & Transfers</em>, or <em>Just for Kids</em> + <em>Sports and Relaxation</em> + <em>Everything
                    else</em> =
                    <em>Activities</em>).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Shorter, more descriptive names for some sections</strong>, like <em>Pool & Beach</em>
                    instead of <em>Swim & Sun</em>, or <em>Packages</em> instead of <em>What's included in the
                        packages?</em>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tree Testing</h4>

            <p>To validate our proposition, I set up tree tests on <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal
                Workshop</a>, with tasks based on the most frequently asked questions to customer service. There
                were some concerns in other markets: they felt some things
                would only work in English. So
                I got help from colleagues there to set up similar tests in German, French and Dutch.</p>


            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p><strong>We saw increased success rate, less hesitation and lower completion times</strong> for most
                tasks. But there
                were a few things to fine tune. For instance, a section about the location of the hotel was added
                (instead of having that information in <em>Hotel Highlights</em>). I organised a new test to
                validate this new proposition.
            </p>

            <h4>Re-design and test</h4>
            <p>In some cases, we also needed design changes, so I discussed possible
                solutions
                with the designer and developers, and then
                tested them with users.
            </p>

            >
            <figcaption>Originally, the video (a button in hotel highlight) was too hard too find.
                Testing showed that users expected the video within the image carousel. But
                that would have slowed down loading. So instead, we settled on a vignette below the carousel.

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="Results" }}
        <p>Changes were gradually rolled out to measure effects, for instance:
        <ul>
            <li>Changes around Room Details and Board Type led to an <strong>increase of 3.5% in conversions</strong>.</li>
            <li>The new location and design for videos led to an <strong>increase of 349% in engagement</strong> with that content
                (and interacting with the video has the highest associated conversion rate of all
                clickable elements on the page).
            </li>
        </ul>

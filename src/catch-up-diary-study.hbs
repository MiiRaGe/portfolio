                <h3>The challenge</h3>
                <p>Evaluate the value of the BBC's new "Story Explorer", in particular:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>can it help regular viewers remember what happened in previous seasons of a drama?</li>
                    <li>is it useful for new viewers who haven't followed previous seasons?</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>My role</h3>
              <p>As a UX consultant at System Concepts, I:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Planned and executed a diary study and follow-up one-to-one sessions.</li>
                  <li>Presented findings to the client and lead discussions around the possible improvements.</li>
                  <li>Delivered a report containing all the findings and prioritised recommendations.</li>
              </ul>

                <div class="stepDetails">
                    <p>We chose to run a diary study so we could get a glimpse of users' behaviours over a longer period
                        of time.
                        This was essential to answer the key research question around whether the platform could really
                        be useful while following a show.
                        The <a href="http://homefront.ch.bbc.co.uk/">test site for the Story Explorer platform</a> had
                        been built around a radio drama called Home Front,
                        whose new season was about to air. We planned the diary study so it would coincide with this new
                        season.
                        14 participants were recruited, with a mix of people who were already listening to the drama,
                        and people who were about to start following it.</p>

                <div class="stepDetails">
                    <p>Once the initial planning stage was over, I started preparing for the study:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I set up the individual blogs participants were going to use to record their experiences.
                        </li>
                        <li>I organised face-to-face briefings with the participants to engage them in the research and
                            ensure they fully understood what was required of them.
                        </li>
                        <li>I prepared a pack for participants to take away after the briefing session, with clear
                            instructions, reminders, and my contact details.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h4>Diary Study</h4>
                </div>
                <div class="stepDetails">
                    <p>I monitored participants' diary entries and sent them
                        questions and prompt when needed. In parallel, I worked on the discussion guide for the
                        follow-up interviews.</p>
                    <p>After 14 days, I selected the participants who had contributed the most interesting diaries and
                        invited them to take part to follow-up interviews.
                        During the interviews, I went back over some of the things they wrote about in their diaries,
                        and asked them to complete tasks to explore features that hadn't been naturally discovered.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The study allowed to get a glimpse of how and when users consumed the content of the platform in their
            day-to-day lives and what impact it made.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this data, I was able to lead discussions into the direction to take for future development. Some
            of the changes made include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>more focus on mobile and tablet devices,</li>
            <li>more content to understand the period and context of the story,</li>
            <li>shorter recaps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another thing that came out of the research was that there was a strong appetite to access a similar
            platform for TV dramas, so <a href="http://peakyblinders.ch.bbc.co.uk/">the latest prototype</a> focuses on
            the show Peaky Blinders.</p>

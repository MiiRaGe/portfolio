        <p>The BBC commissioned <a href="https://www.system-concepts.com/">System Concepts</a> to help evaluate a new
            concept, the <em>Story Explorer</em></em>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Can it help regular viewers remember what happened in previous seasons of a drama?
            </li>
            <li>Is it useful for new viewers who haven't followed previous seasons?</li>
            <li>Does it drive engagement with the shows?</li>

            <h4>Planning and preparation</h4>
            <p>To answer the research questions, we needed to get a glimpse of users' behaviours over a longer period
                of time, while following a show.
                So, we agreed to run a diary study, starting at the same time as the new season of Home Front, the radio
                drama
                featured in the
                <a href="http://homefront.ch.bbc.co.uk/">Story Explorer prototype</a>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I liaised with an external agency to <strong>recruit</strong> 14 participants, with a mix of
                    existing listeners, and people I asked to start listening at the beginning of the study.
                </li>
                <li>I set up <strong>blogs</strong> for participants to record their experiences. We chose blogs because
                    the team at the BBC was eager to follow the study in real time.
                </li>
                <li>I prepared a <strong>package for the participants</strong>, to give out after the briefings. It
                    contained clear
                    instructions, reminders, and my contact details.
                </li>
                <li>I organised <strong>face-to-face briefings with the participants</strong> to engage them in the
                    research and
                    ensure they fully understood what was required of them.
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h4>Diary Study</h4>
            <p>I monitored participants' diary entries and sent them
                questions and prompt when needed. In parallel, I worked on the discussion guide for the
                follow-up interviews.</p>

            <p>The interviews were conducted by fellow consultant Maria, while I
                stayed in the observation room with our clients, to facilitate discussions.</p>
            <p>During the interviews, we went back over the things participants wrote in their diaries,
                and asked them to complete tasks to explore features that hadn't been naturally discovered.</p>

            <h4>Main findings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>New listeners: Really appreciate being able to only follow one character or storyline that
                    especially interested in.
                </li>
                <li>One of the most liked content was the contextual information (historical bakcground, psychological
                    or social issues), trusted BBC source
                </li>
            </ul>

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="Results" }}
        <p>The study allowed to get a glimpse of how and when users consumed the content of the platform in their
            day-to-day lives and what impact it made.</p>
        <p>Thanks to this data, I was able to lead discussions into the direction to take for future development. Some
            of the changes made include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>more focus on mobile and tablet devices,</li>
            <li>more content to understand the period and context of the story,</li>
            <li>shorter recaps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Another thing that came out of the research was that there was a strong appetite to access a similar
            platform for TV dramas, so <a href="http://peakyblinders.ch.bbc.co.uk/">the latest prototype</a> focuses on
            the show Peaky Blinders.</p>   {{/case/paragraphe}}

        <p>We were bombarded with requests to add more features, or put the sign up button
            in more places. But there was little data to back that up! So, I conducted research
            to help us decide what to prioritise.</p>

            On mobile, the drop out rate during sign up was high, mostly due to the date of birth field (screenshot
            from
            Clicktale).

            <h4>Research questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Are there issues stopping users from signing up?</li>
                <li>Can users find where to sign up? Are we promoting sign up right?</li>
                <li>Are there market specificities we should be aware of?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Methodologies used</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Click tests on <a href="https://www.userzoom.com/">Userzoom</a>.</li>
                <li>User testing.</li>
                <li>Review existing in-house research into country specifics.
                </li>
                <li>Gather quantitative data from <a
                        href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and
                    <a
                            href="https://www.clicktale.com/">Clicktale.</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>No need to go too heavy on the Sign ups CTAs. Users can find it already, and it's getting a bit too
                    much. Instead, we should think of
                    the right context to promote sign up, and review our copy.
                </li>
                <li>Drop out rates on mobile (which accounts for 70% of H&M's visitors) is 30% higher than on desktop:
                    no wonder when it takes 40s longer to sign up, and there's severe usability issues (especially on
                    Android).
                </li>
                <li>In some countries, we must provide more sign-up options.
                </li>
            </ul>

        {{#> case/rightColumn}}


            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>The date of birth was by far the biggest drop off point in the sign up form.
            </p>
            <h4>How might we solve it?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stop to require the date of birth:</strong>
                    The Product Owner and I started discussions with our stakeholders:
                    Why do we need the date of birth? How else can we collect it? I prototyped
                    a few ideas to help kickstart things.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Change the input method</strong>: with a precise date so far back in the past, a calendar
                    (Android) or a
                    scrollable list (iOS) are not the most appropriate. I reviewed existing research and guidelines
                    (like
                    <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/#asking-for-memorable-dates">Research
                        by gov.uk</a> and <a href="https://material.io/components/date-pickers#mobile-pickers">Material
                        Design</a>) and sketched out two ideas.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Design review</h4>
            <p>I took the ideas to our daily Design Review.
                We decided on the solution that allowed to stick to existing components in our Design System: simple
                input, split in 3 fields (day, month, year), with
                one visible label.</p>
            <h4>A/B Test</h4>
            <p><strong>Drop outs and time to complete the form decreased.</strong>
                And the rate of errors when filling in the form did not significantly change like we could have
                feared. </p>
            <h4>Next?</h4>
            <p>Address the next big drop off points: unclear password rules and error messages.</p>

            In user testing, participants were unimpressed with the copy on the page between shopping bag and checkout.
        {{/case/leftColumn}}
        {{#> case/rightColumn}}
            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
            <p>Promoting sign up in the checkout is where it makes more sense for user: they get
                immediate benefits from it (like free shipping and
                discounts). And user testing pointed to some easy improvements, like tweaking the copy.</p>
            <h4>Ideation Workshop</h4>
            <p>I invited business experts,
                designers, product owners and analysts from loyalty and checkout teams to a workshop to generate ideas
                together.
                The workshop was very appreciated, as it brought together people who were not often in the
                same room, or didnâ€™t feel involved in design decisions.</p>

            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>We generated a prioritised list of ideas to A/B test. The first one, was to
                <strong>change the labels on the CTAs to continue to checkout.</strong>, and it performed well.</p>

            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>In the winter of 2020, the membership will be launched in a country where email usage is very low, and
                social sign up is preferred
                (I won't reveal details or show designs as the launch is still confidential).</p>
            <h4>Understand the market and the platform</h4>
            <p>I did some reading to understand the market better.
                And we met with our colleagues in that market to share knowledge and build a closer
                relationship.</p>
            <h4>Discuss technical limitations and draw up user flows</h4>
            <p>I worked closely with our IT Architect and Developers to understand technical limitations
                and draw up user flows where all scenarios are accounted for.
                I had to make assumptions about
                what would be the most user-friendly solutions, but was hoping to be able to test those soon.
            </p>
            <h4>Sketch, Design Review, Prototype</h4>
            <p>I sketched out different ideas for a layout to accommodate extra sign up options. I selected three
                thanks to feedback received in Design Review, then prepared prototypes for user test.</p>
            <h4>Test and Adjust</h4>
            <p>In user testing, I observed that one layout resulted in less errors than the others. However, no clear
                insights emerged around some of the tricky points in the journey, like signing up directly from the
                social
                media platform.

        <p>After 4 months in the team, I had to join another team, in the wake of cut hours due to Covid-19. When I left

            confident in prioritising their backlog and handling stakeholders.</p>

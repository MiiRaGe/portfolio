        <p>15% of H&M online customers are not members of the loyalty program.
            How might we encourage them to sign up?</p>
    {{/case/paragraphe}}

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="My role" }}
        <p><strong>Product Designer</strong> in a Team in charge of increasing the number of sign ups. The team hadn't
            had a Product Designer before.

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="The process" }}
        <p>When I joined, the team was bombarded with requests to add more features, or put the sign up button
            in more places. But there was little data to back that up! So, I conducted research
            to help us decide what to prioritise.</p>

        {{#> case/leftColumn title="Research" img="img/hm1_signup_Clicktale.png" alt="21% drop out at the date of birth. Drop out is much lower for other fields (3 to 4%)" }}
            Lots of users didn't complete the sign up form, mostly because of the date of birth field (screenshot
                from
                Clicktale).

        {{/case/leftColumn}}
        {{#> case/rightColumn}}
            <h4>Click test</h4>
            <p>A common hypothesis was that it was difficult to find where to sign up. To look
                into that, I used click tests on <a href="https://www.userzoom.com/">Userzoom</a>. The results? A
                success rate over 90% in all scenarios.</p>

            <h4>User testing</h4>
            <p>I conducted user testing, that I invited the team to watch. The sessions highlighted
                many severe usability issues on mobile, and some smaller problems on desktop.</p>

            <h4>Store experience and international perspective</h4>
            <p>I reviewed
                insights from wider research into the loyalty program in stores around the world.
                The key takeaways were that signing up takes too long, and that the ways to sign up are not adapted to
                all
                markets.</p>

            <h4>Quantitative data</h4>
            <p>To understand the true scale of the issues identified , I looked at <a
                    href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.clicktale.com/">Clicktale.</a>
                The figures for mobile (which accounts for 70% of H&M's visitors globally) were not good:
            <ul>
                <li>Signing up took 40 seconds more than on desktop, on average.</li>
                <li>The drop out rate was 30% higher.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>Prioritise and communicate</h4>
            <p>I presented the results to the team. We established our priority for the upcoming sprints, based on
                effort and impact.</p>
            <p>Then, I built a quick showcase for our Sprint Demo. This helped stakeholders to understand our strategy
                and accept that we would not be focusing on some of the new features they were keen on.</p>

            A participant in user test, unsure how to change her birth year in the date picker (on Android).
        {{/case/leftColumn}}
        {{#> case/rightColumn}}


            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>The date of birth was by far the biggest drop off point in the sign up form.</li>
            </p>
            <h4>How might we solve it?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Stop to require the date of birth:
                    The Product Owner and I started discussions with our stakeholders:
                    Why do we need the date of birth? How else can we collect it? I prototyped
                    a few ideas to help kickstart things.
                </li>
                <li>Change the input method: with a precise date so far back in the past, a calendar (Android) or a
                    scrollable list (iOS) are not the most appropriate. I reviewed existing research and guidelines
                    (like
                    <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/#asking-for-memorable-dates">Research
                        by gov.uk</a> and <a href="https://material.io/components/date-pickers#mobile-pickers">Material
                        Design
                        Date pickers</a>) and sketched out two ideas.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Design review</h4>
            <p>I got feedback on the solutions from other Designers at our daily Design Review.
                We decided on the solution that allowed to stick to existing components in our Design System: simple
                input, split in 3 fields (day, month, year), with only
                one visible label.</p>
            <h4>A/B Test</h4>
            <p>The new input method resulted in 10% less drop outs, and the time taken to fill in the form decreased by
                25s, to 50s.
                The rate of errors when filling in the form did not significantly change like we could have feared. </p>
            <h4>Next?</h4>
            <p>Address the next big drop off points: unclear password rules and error messages.</p>

            In user testing, participants were unimpressed with the copy about membership at the checkout...
        {{/case/leftColumn}}
        {{#> case/rightColumn}}
            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
            <p>Promoting joining in the checkout is where it makes more sense from a user point of view: they get
                immediate benefits from it (like free shipping and
                discounts). And user testing pointed to some easy improvements, like tweaking the copy.</p>
            <h4>Ideation Workshop</h4>
            <p>I invited business experts,
                designers, product owners and analysts from relevant teams to a workshop to generate ideas together.
                The workshop was very appreciated, as it brought together people who were not often in the
                same room, or didnâ€™t feel involved in design decisions.</p>

            <h4>Outcomes</h4>
            <p>We generated a prioritised list of ideas to A/B test. The first one, which performed well, was to
                change the labels on the CTAs to continue to checkout.</p>

            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>In the winter of 2020, the membership will be launched in a country where email usage is very low, and
                social sign up is preferred
                (I won't reveal details or show designs as the launch is still confidential).</p>
            <h4>Understand the market and the platform</h4>
            <p>I did some reading to understand the market better, and started to use the app from the social media
                platform we were going to work with.
                My teamates and I also met with our colleagues in that market to share knowledge and build a closer
                relationship.</p>
            <h4>Discuss technical limitations and draw up user flows</h4>
            <p>I worked closely with our IT Architect and Developers to understand technical limitations
                and draw up user flows where all scenarios are accounted for.
                I had to make assumptions about
                what would be the most user-friendly solutions, but was hoping to be able to test those soon.
            </p>
            <h4>Sketch, Design Review, Prototype</h4>
            <p>I sketched out different ideas for a layout to accommodate extra sign up options. I selected three
                thanks to feedback received in Design Review, then prepared prototypes for user test.</p>
            <h4>Test and Adjust</h4>
            <p>In user testing, I observed that one layout resulted in less errors than the others.</p>

            <li>Drop outs in the sign up form <strong>decreased by 10%</strong></li>
            <li>The first A/B tests around promoting sign up in the checkout resulted in increased sign ups. Some other

        <p>After 4 months in the team, I got assigned elsewhere in the wake of cut hours due to Covid-19. When I left
            the team, they thanked me for helping them to become more user-centered, more data-driven, and more
            confident in prioritising their backlog and handling stakeholders.</p>

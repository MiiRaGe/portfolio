    <p>15% of H&M online customers are not members of the loyalty program.
    How do we encourage more customers to sign up?</p>
     {{/case/paragraphe}}

    {{#> case/paragraphe title="The process" }}
    <p>For 4 months, I was the Product Designer in a Product Team in charge of increasing the number of sign ups. The team had been created just a few months beforehand
    and did not have a Designer before.</p>
    <p>We received lots of requests to add more features, or put the sign up button
                in more places. But there was little data to back up those requests. So, I started with some research
                to help the team make informed decisions.</p>

            <div>Most users who stop filling in the form do so because of the date of birth field (screenshot from Clicktale).</div>

             <h4>Click test</h4>
             <p>A common hypothesis was that it was too difficult to find where to sign up. To look
             into that, I used click tests on <a href="https://www.userzoom.com/">Userzoom</a>. The results? A success rate over 90% in all scenarios.</p>

             <h4>User testing</h4>
            <p>I conducted user testing, that I invited the team to watch. The sessions highlighted
             many severe usability issues on mobile, and some smaller problems on desktop.</p>

             <h4>Store experience and international perspective</h4>
             <p>I reviewed
              insights from wider research into the loyalty program experience in stores around the world.
             The key takeaways were that signing up takes too long, and the ways to sign up are not adapted to all markets.</p>

            <h4>Quantitative data</h4>
            <p>To understand the true scale of the issues identified so far, I gathered data from <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.clicktale.com/">Clicktale.</a>
            The figures for mobile (which accounts for about 70% of H&M's visitors globally) were not good:
                <ul>
                    <li>Signing up took 40 seconds more than on desktop, on average.</li>
                    <li>The drop out rate was 30% higher.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>What next?</h4>
            <p>I presented the results to the team. We established our priority for the upcoming sprints, based on effort and impact.</p>
    <p>Then, I built a quick showcase for our Sprint Demo. This helped stakeholders to understand our strategy and accept that we would not be focusing on some of the new features they were keen on.</p>

        {{/case/leftColumn}}
        {{#> case/rightColumn}}


               <h4>The problem</h4>
               <p>The date of birth was by far the biggest drop off point in the form. Especially on Android, where most users couldn't figure out how to change the year in the date picker.</li>
                </p>
                <h4>How might we solve it?</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stop to require the date of birth: this decision wasn't in the team's hands.
                    The Product Owner and I started discussions with our stakeholders:
                    Why do we need the date of birth? How else can we collect it? I prototyped
                    a few ideas to help kickstart things.
                   </li>
                   <li>Change the input method: with a precise date so far back in the past, a calendar (Android) or a scrollable list (iOS) are not the most appropriate. I reviewed existing research and guidelines (like
                   <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/#asking-for-memorable-dates">Research
                   by gov.uk</a> and  <a href="https://material.io/components/date-pickers#mobile-pickers">Material Design
                   Date pickers</a>) and sketched out two ideas.
                   </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Design review</h4>
                <p>I got feedback on the solutions from other Designers at our daily Design Review.
                We decided on the solution that allowed to stick to existing components in our Design System: simple input, split in 3 fields (day, month, year), with only
                   one visible label.</p>
                <h4>A/B Test</h4>
                <p>The new input method resulted in 10% less drop outs, and the time taken to fill in the form decreased by 25s, to 50s.
                The rate of errors when filling in the form did not significantly change like we could have feared.   </p>
                <h4>Next?</h4>
                <p>Address the next big drop off points: clearer password rules, and error messages.</p>

        <h4>Opportunity</h4>
              <p>A key opportunity we identified was to promote joining in the checkout. It is where it makes
                            the most sense to users: they get immediate benefits from it (like free shipping and
                            discounts).</p>
        <h4>Ideation workshop</h4>
                        <p>The checkout is an area many teams have a stake in. So, I invited business experts,
                            designers, product owners and analysts to a workshop to generate ideas together.</p>
                        <p>The workshop was very appreciated, as it brought together people who were not often in the
                            same room, or didnâ€™t feel involved in design decisions. However, the schedule had been a
                            little bit too tight.</p>

        <h4>Outcomes</h4>
        <p>We generated a prioritised list of ideas to A/B test. The first one, which performed well, was to
        change the labels on the CTAs to continue to checkout.</p>

               <p>H&M didn't offer social sign up. But it some markets, that is really critical. The membership will be launched in one of those markets in the fall of 2020 (confidential for now so
               details will be obscured). We set out to provide
               sign up through the most popular platform in that country.</p>
               <h4>Understand the market</h4>
               <p>I did some reading to understand the market better, and of course started to use the app from the social media platform we were going to work with.</p>
               <p>My teamates and I also met with our colleagues in the market to share knowledge and build a closer
               relationship.</p>
               <h4>Flows</h4>
               <p>I worked closely with our IT Architect and Developers to understand technical limitations
               and draw up a user flow where all scenarios were accounted for. I had to make assumptions about
               what would be the most user-friendly solutions, but was hoping to be able to test those soon.
               </p>
               <h4>Sketch, Prototype</h4>
               <p>I sketched out different ideas for a layout to accommodate extra sign up options. I selected three
               thanks to feedback received in Design Review, then prepared prototypes for user test.</p>
               <h4>Test and Adjust<h4>
               <p>Participants in the country we were focusing on were difficult to recruit.
               So to gain time, I ran a quick unmoderated user test with US participants.
               The test showed that one layout resulted in less errors than the others, but would need some tweaks.</p>
               <p>I had planned an extra test with "local" participants with a greater focus on the full
               sign up flow and on things specific to the local social media platform. But I did not carry
                that out, as I got assigned to a different team in the wake of cut hours due to Covid-19.</p>

        <p>As a direct result of the changes implemented on mobile:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The average time it takes to join the loyalty program was reduced by 25s.</li>
                <li>Drop outs in the sign up form decreased by 10%.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first A/B tests around promoting sign up in the checkout resulted in increased sign ups. Some other
                ideas are still being tested.</p>
            <p>The local sign up has not launched yet.</p>

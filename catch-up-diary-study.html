              <h4>Overview of the project</h4>
              <p>The BBC has developed a platform called the "Story Explorer" to help catch-up on previous seasons of a drama. They wanted to find out if:
                <ul>
                    <li>the platform is useful for new viewers who haven't followed previous seasons.</li>
                    <li>the platform can help regular viewers remember what happened.</li>
                    <li>it makes sense to organise the content around storyline and characters rather than by episodes.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h4>My role</h4>
                    <p>As a UX consultant at System Concepts, I:</p>
                    <ul class="list-top">
                        <li>Planned and executed a diary study and follow-up one-to-one sessions.</li>
                        <li>Presented findings to the client and lead discussions around the possible improvements.</li>
                        <li>Delivered a report containing all the findings and prioritised recommendations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I was the lead researcher on this project, and was assisted by another consultant.</p>
              <h4>The research</h4>
                   <img src="img/bbc-hr-story.png" alt="" class="illustration-right">
              <p>We chose to run a diary study so we could get a glimpse of users' behaviours over a longer period of time,
                  which was essential to answer the key research question around whether the platform could really be useful while following the show.
              The <a href="http://homefront.ch.bbc.co.uk/">test site for the Story Explorer platform</a> had been built around a radio drama called Home Front,
              whose new season was about to air for 2 weeks, with 1 episode broadcast every day. We planned the diary study so it would coincide with this new season.
              14 participants were recruited, with a mix of people who were already listening to the dramas, and people who were about to start following it.</p>
              <p>Once the initial planning stage was over, I started diving into the preparation for the study and:
                 <ul>
                    <li>set up the individual blogs participants were going to use to record their experiences.</li>
                    <li>organised face-to-face briefings with the participants to engage them in the research and ensure that they fully understood what was required of them.</li>
                    <li>prepared a pack for participants to take away after the briefing session, with clear instructions, reminders, and my contact details.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Once I had met the participants during the briefing sessions, the actual diary study began. I monitored participants' diary entries and sent them
              questions and prompt when needed. In parallel, I worked on the discussion guide for the follow-up interviews.</p>
              <p>After 14 days, I selected the participants who had contributed the most interesting diaries and invited them to take part to follow-up interviews.
              During the interviews, I went back over some of the things they wrote about in their diaries, and asked them to complete tasks to explore features that hadn't been naturally discovered.</p>
                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
              <p>The study:
                     <ul>
                         <li>allowed to get a glimpse of how and when users consumed the content of the platform in their day-to-day lives.</li>
                         <li>helped to validate the interest of the platform and the way content was structured.</li>
                         <li>informed the direction to take for future development: a focus on mobile and tablet devices, more content to understand the period and context
                         of the story, and shorter recaps. Another thing that came out of the research was that there was a strong appetite to access a similar
                         platform for TV dramas, so <a href="http://peakyblinders.ch.bbc.co.uk/">the latest prototype</a> focuses on the show Peaky Binders .</li>

            <h3>Informing the re-design of a Search Results Page</h3>
              <p class="client">Thomas Cook</p>

                <h4>Overview of the project</h4>

                    <p>The <a href="https://www.thomascook.com/">Thomas Cook</a> search results page looked dated. On top of that,
                        users complained that it was slow, and that the information was difficult to understand.</br>
                        A full re-design was needed, and user research was essential to make sure the changes weren't just cosmetic.
                        </p>
                    <h4>My role</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Plan and execute the research activities needed to identify pain points on the current page, and validate design decisions.</li>
                            <li>Communicate the findings to make sure all stakeholders have a good understanding of users' needs and behaviours.</li>
                            <li>Use the knowledge from the qualitative research to help understand the quantitative results.</li>
                        </ul>
                <h4>The research</h4>
                    <p>Some of the key activities that I lead:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify issues, based on the data of qualitative and quantitative research, as well as queries to call centers.</li>
                        <li>Facilitate usability testing with a series of pre-defined tasks, to investigate problem areas and potential fixes.</li>
                        <li>Observe and interview users who are looking for their actual holidays, on a range of travel websites. This helped to understand:
                            <ul>
                                <li>what information really matters to users to make a decision</li>
                                <li>how users scan through the results,</li>
                                <li>what works well on competitors' sites.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                <p>This is an on-going project. The Result Cards have been fully re-designed, and we are now working on the filters.</p>

                    </figure>
                <p>The most important changes so far are that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The amount of content on each result card has been reduced. This was a controversial change, so being able to back up the decisions with research data was very important.</li>
                                <li>The design of the cards is cleaner, with one column, more white space, and icons. It makes it easier to scan the information.</li>
                            </ul>
                    <p>Users can now quickly find the information they need to decide if they are interested in a holiday or not: we've measured a decrease in the number of product pages users have to visit before making a decision and booking.</p>

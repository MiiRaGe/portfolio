            <h3>Informing the re-design of a Search Results Page</h3>

                <h4>Overview of the project</h4>
                    <p>The <a href="https://www.thomascook.com/">Thomas Cook</a> search results page looked dated. On top of that,
                        previous research showed that users couldn't easily find and compare information on the page.
                        A full re-design was needed, and research was essential to make sure the changes weren't just cosmetic.
                    </p>
                <h4>My role</h4>
                     <p>As a senior UX Researcher at Thomas Cook, I:</p>
                        <ul class="list-top">
                            <li>Planned and executed several rounds of remote testing to inform the re-design of the page and validate changes.</li>
                            <li>Communicated the findings to make sure all stakeholders had a good understanding of users' needs and behaviours.</li>
                            <li>Used the knowledge from the qualitative research to help understand the quantitative results.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h4>The research</h4>

                                    <p>I started by remotely observing a range of users while they looked for their actual holidays on their favourite travel sites.
                                        Conducting this research remotely allowed to reach users from different parts of the country, which was essential:
                                        where people live has an influence on what they care about when choosing their package holiday.</p>
                                    <p>After this round of research, I showed some typical user journeys and some video clips to the team to demonstrate:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>how users scanned through the results,</li>
                                                <li>what information really mattered to decide between different search results,</li>
                                                <li>what worked well on competitors' sites.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                    <p>Based on this, a UX Designer produced a prototype, and I set up some unmorederated remote tests to validate it:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>the first test consisted in asking users to find specific information either on the current page or on the prototype.
                                            This helped to validate that finding information was easier with the new layout.</li>
                                        <li>later tests focused on the amount of information. One group of user was shown a prototype with all the information
                                        we had on the current page, and another a prototype with all the information that we felt could be left out (based on the
                                        user behaviours observed in the earlier research). The task was to find a holiday they liked, and at the end of the
                                        test I asked questions specific to the amount of information. Based on the result of these tests, we re-introduce some of the
                                        information we had initially planned the delete.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <figure>
                                        <img src="img/tc-srp.png" alt="" class="illustration-l">

                            </div>
                    </div>

                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                <p>This is an on-going project. The Result Cards have been fully re-designed, and we are now working on the filters.</p>

                    <img src="img/tc-srp-phone.png" alt="" class="illustration-s"/>
                <p>The most important changes so far are that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The amount of content on each card has been reduced. This was a controversial change, so being able to back up the decisions with research data was very important.</li>
                                <li>The design of the cards is cleaner, with one column, more white space, and icons. It makes it easier to scan the information.</li>
                            </ul>
                    <p>The new cards have been a success. When they were A/B tested, we've measured a decrease in the number of product pages users have to visit before making a decision and booking.</p>

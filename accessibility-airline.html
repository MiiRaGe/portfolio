            <h3>Improving the accessibility of airline websites</h3>
              <p class="client">Amadeus and various airlines</p>
              <h4>Overview of the project</h4>

                        <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a rule requiring Airlines' websites to comply to level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (WCAG v2.0) by the end of 2015.
                            I have worked to achieve this goal with Amadeus on the
                            <a href="http://www.amadeus.com/web/amadeus/en_1A-corporate/Airlines/Airline-Systems/Digital-and-Direct-Retailing-Systems/Retailing-User-Interfaces/Amadeus-e-Retail/1400000043062-Solution_C-AMAD_ProductDetailPpal-1319637765587?category=1400000042013&industrySegment=1259068355670&system=1400000001026">e-Retail booking system</a>,
                            which is used by over a hundred airlines, as well as directly with various airlines such as Japan Airlines, Avianca or China Southern Airlines.</p>
                    <h4>My role</h4>
                    <p>As an intern at Amadeus, and later as a UX consultant at System Concepts, I have conducted:</p>
                    <ul class="list-top">
                        <li>Accessibility audits.</li>
                        <li>Accessibility testing.</li>
                        <li>Training sessions tailored to various teams (Project Management, Development, QA, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>

              <h4>The work</h4>

                       <div class="steps-details">
                            <p>I have conducted multiple audits against the WCAG 2.0 guidelines. When conducting the audits, I examine the pages with:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>common assistive technologies (such as the screen reader JAWS)</li>
                              <li>specific accessibility settings (like inverted colors)</li>
                              <li>tools like the Web Developper browser extension</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This allows to spot problems. I then dive into the code of the pages to pin-point what causes the issues and how to fix them.</p>

                        <p>I have delivered short training sessions to teams at Amadeus to help them understand why accessibility matters and how they could

                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Big accessibility issues have been addressed throughout the booking flow: there are no more problems that would completely stop one category of users from accessing a page (for instance, all elements can be accessed with a keyboard).</li>
                        <li>Effort has been put to improve complex pages such as the one displaying flight availability.</li>
                        <li>All the work done to improve accessibility has also been used to improve the general usability and look and feel of the pages.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <figcaption>A search panel as it was before the accessibility work began in 2013, and as it is now. The numbers on a red background on the before screenshot indicate table depth: layout tables were used, and there were up to 8 imbricated tables on the page. Today, there are none. </figcaption>

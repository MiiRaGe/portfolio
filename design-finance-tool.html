                      <h4>The challenge</h4>
                  <p>The Money Advice Service was commissioned by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to build <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/money-manager">a website</a> offering financial support to people on Universal Credit.
                      The original prototype didn't meet users' needs at all, so they decided to start from scratch.</p>
                  </div>
              </div>

              <div id="role">
                    <h4>My role</h4>
                    <p>As a UX consultant at System Concepts, I:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assisted the lead researcher (note-taking, analysis, communicating the findings).</li>
                        <li>Facilitated workshops with stakeholders to define user needs, outline personas and map key user journeys.</li>
                        <li>Produced sketches, wireframes and a high-fidelity responsive prototype in Axure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I worked alongside a researcher from the DWP.</p>

                            <p>Given the limited time that was allocated to the discovery phase, the best way to gain a better understanding of our target audience
                               was to go meet them directly at Job Centres and conduct interviews.
                               We focused on uncovering how our users managed their money and what their pain points were.</p>

                            <p>I held a series of workshops to collectively digest the findings from the interviews
                                and define the user needs and personas.
                                All the key stakeholders (who came from different organisations) were involved. </p>

                                    These were regularly shared with stakeholders, taken out for guerrilla testing and updated.

                                  For the first iterations we focused on the mobile versions of the product, before moving on to other screen sizes.

                                    When we were satisfied that the product was going in the right direction, I created a higher fidelity fully responsive
                                    prototype to allow us to test the interaction mechanisms during lab testing sessions with users. For this prototype,
                                    I worked with a visual designer and a copywriter to refine the visual design and content.

                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We designed a MVP that answered real user needs while still meeting key expectations from the people who commissioned the tool.</li>
                            <li>For this project, a big part of the job was getting people to empathise with our users. The tool is aimed at people who generally feel everyone looks down on them, so
                                we really needed to get the tone right for them to feel respected.
                                Iâ€™m proud that I managed to get people from various teams involved in outlining the user needs, personas and user journeys.
                                I was adaptable, took the time to explain UCD processes and lead the discussions using the methods that would resonate the most with the people I worked with.</li>

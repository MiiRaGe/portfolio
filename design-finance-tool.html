              <h4>Overview of the project</h4>
              <p>The Money Advice Service was commissioned by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to build <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/money-manager">a website</a> offering financial support to people on Universal Credit.
                            They had prepared a prototype in Axure, but received very negative feedback during user testing.
                            They decided to take a step back and brought 2 consultants to the project (a visual designer and me), as well as a researcher from the DWP.
                            </br>Our mission was to re-shape this product and ensure it met user needs and stakeholders’ expectations.
                    <h4>My role</h4>
              <p>As a UX consultant at System Concepts, I:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assisted the lead researcher (note-taking, analysis, communicate the findings).</li>
                        <li>Facilitated workshops with stakeholders to define user needs, outline personas and map key users journeys.</li>
                        <li>Produced sketches, wireframes and a high-fidelity responsive prototype in Axure.</li>
                    </ul>
              <h4>The work</h4>
              <p>As part of the discovery phase:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>I visited Job Centres with another researcher to interview users.
                      We wanted to gain a better understanding of our target audience,
                  especially how they managed their money and what their pain points were</li>
                  <li>I held a series of workshop with stakeholders to define the user needs, outline personas and map key users journeys.</li>
                  <li>I then went on to create a prioritised list of user needs, as well as visualisations of the personas and user journeys.
                    These were used to lead discussions to prioritise the key features to include in the first version of the product.</li>
              </ul>

                  <figcaption>Early paper sketch</figcaption>
              </figure>
              <p>Based on the insights from the discovery phase, I produced sketches, and then low-fidelity wireframes in Axure.
                    These were regularly shared with stakeholders, taken out for guerrilla testing and updated.

                  For the first iterations we focused on the mobile versions of the product, before moving on to other screen sizes.

              <p>
                    When we were satisfied that the product was going in the right direction, I created a higher fidelity fully responsive
                    prototype to allow us to test the interaction mechanisms during lab testing sessions with users. For this prototype,
                    I worked with a visual designer and a copywriter to refine the visual design and content.
              </p>
                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We designed a MVP that answered real user needs while still meeting key expectations from the people who commissioned the tool.</li>
                            <li>For this project, a big part of the job was getting people to empathise with our users: we were talking to people who felt everyone looks down on them.
                                As the only UX Designer on the project, I’m proud that I managed to get people from various teams involved in outlining the user needs, personas and user journeys.
                                I was adaptable, took the time to explain UCD processes and lead the discussions using the methods that would resonate the most with the people I worked with.</li>
                        </ul>

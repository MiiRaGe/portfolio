                <h4>Overview of the project</h4>

                        <p>The product page on the <a href="https://www.thomascook.com/">Thomas Cook website</a> contains a lot of details: in-depth
                            look at all the hotel facilities, what's included in each package, rooms and flights selection, etc. </br></br>
                            All this information is essential to some of our users at a point in their journey. But they struggle to find what they are looking for, so we decided to
                        re-think the way the content is organised on the page.</p>
                    <h4>My role</h4>
              <p>As a Senior UX Researcher at Thomas Cook, I conducted:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>User testing to understand why users cannot find information,</li>
                        <li>Card sorting to find out how users group the content and name the sections, and then used the findings to facilitate discussions around the re-organisation of the content,</li>
                        <li>Tree Testing to evaluate the new content organisation.</li>
                    </ul>
              <h4>The work</h4>
              <p>
              I started by running some user testing to understand why the call centers were receiving so many queries about the content of the page.
              <ul>
                <li>One of the reasons was that several section names contained the same keywords (for instance "Hotel Highlights" and "Your Hotel").
                    As soon as users saw a section containing the keyword they were looking for, they assumed all the information available was in that section.</li>
                <li>Another common reason was that some content just wasn't in the place users expected it to be.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
              With that in mind, I organised on online card sorting exercise to find out how users naturally grouped the content and how they named the sections.
              We discovered that some of the section we had thought of as essential (like the one about all the features for children) weren't needed. The card sorting
              also proved that users chose section names that were more descriptive and short than the current names (for instance "Pool & Beach" for the content about the pool and the nearby beach,
              and not "Swim & Sun").
              </br>I presented these results to the team in charge of the content. There were some surprises, but we still managed to agree on a new way to organise
              the content.
              </p>
              <p>We needed to validate our proposition before changing thousands of product pages. To do that, I organised 2 tree tests: the first one for the proposed organisation, and the second one for the current organisation. The results helped
                  to validate the changes by showing that with the new tree, users can find the information that was causing problems before, and it takes them less time to get there.
              </p>
                <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                <p>We just finished the tree testing. Once the changes are implemented, all product pages will have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Content that is organised logically, in a way that mirrors what our users are looking for.</li>
                        <li>Section names which are short and describe exactly what the section contains, in our user's own words.</li>
                        <li>A structure which is more flat: only 2 levels of headings, when there could be as much as 4 before.</li>
                    </ul>

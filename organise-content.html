                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                    <p>Make it easier for users to find what they are looking for on the product pages of the <a href="https://www.thomascook.com/">Thomas Cook website</a> which contain a lot of details.</p>
                    <h4>My role</h4>
              <p>As a Senior UX Researcher at Thomas Cook, I conducted:</p>
                    <ul class="list-top">
                        <li>User testing to understand why users cannot find information,</li>
                        <li>Card sorting to find out how users group the content and name the sections, and then used the findings to facilitate discussions around the re-organisation of the content,</li>
                        <li>Tree Testing to evaluate the new content organisation.</li>
                    </ul>
              <h4>The research</h4>

                            <p>I ran some user testing with tasks pushing participants to look for specific pieces of content that I identified as problematic (based on data from the call centers).</p>
                            <p>Some of that content clearly wasn't where users expected it to be, and some things caused confusion:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The structure was very deep.</li>
                                    <li>Several section names contained the same keywords.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <div class="steps-details">
                            <p>I organised an online card sorting exercise to find out how users naturally group the content and name the sections.</p>
                            <p>The results?</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A couple of sections of the page weren't actually groups users naturally thought of. </li>
                                <li>Users chose section names that are more descriptive and shorter than the current names.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I presented these results to the team in charge of the content. There were some surprises, but we still managed to agree on a new way to organise
                          the content that we believed would work better.</p>

                            <p>We needed to validate our proposition before changing thousands of product pages. To do that, I organised 2 tree tests: the first one for the proposed organisation, and the second one for the current organisation.</p>
                            <p>The results helped
                            to validate the changes by showing that with the new tree, users can find the information that was difficult to find before, and it takes them less time to get there.

              <h4>Key achievements</h4>
                <p>We just finished the tree testing. Once the changes are implemented, all product pages will have:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Content that is organised logically, in a way that mirrors what our users are looking for.</li>
                        <li>Section names which are short and describe exactly what each section contains, in our users' own words.</li>
                        <li>A structure which is more flat: only 2 levels of headings.</li>
                    </ul>

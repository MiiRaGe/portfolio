                                <li>the structure was too deep: after expanding a few subsections without finding what they
                                    were looking for, users just gave up.
                                </li>

                                all the issues encountered on the Accommodation page.
                                The outcome? A prioritised list of opportunities to act on, starting with <strong>re-organising the
                                    content of the page, and increasing affordance for key features.</strong></p>

                            <p>I organised a card sorting exercise on <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal Workshop</a> to
                                find out how users naturally group the content
                                and name the sections.</p>
                
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p>A couple of sections of the page weren't groups users naturally thought of, and users chose
                                section names that are more descriptive and shorter than the existing ones.</p>
                            I presented these results to the team. There were surprises, but we managed to
                            agree on a new structure to test. Some of our proposed changes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Remove the <em>Your Hotel</em> section</strong>, which had subsections about
                                    activities and food.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Merge some sections</strong> (for instance: <em>More Flights Options</em> + <em>Your Flight
                                    Details</em> = <em>Flights
                                    & Transfers</em>, or <em>Just for Kids</em> + <em>Sports and Relaxation</em> + <em>Everything
                                    else</em> =
                                    <em>Activities</em>).
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Shorter, more descriptive names for some sections</strong>, like <em>Pool & Beach</em>
                                    instead of <em>Swim & Sun</em>, or <em>Packages</em> instead of <em>What's included in the
                                        packages?</em>
                                </li>

                            <p>To validate our proposition, I set up tree tests on <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal
                                Workshop</a>, with tasks based on the most frequently asked questions to customer service. There
                                were some concerns in other markets: they felt some things
                                would only work in English. So
                                I got help from colleagues there to set up similar tests in German, French and Dutch.</p>
                
                
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p><strong>We saw increased success rate, less hesitation and lower completion times</strong> for most
                                tasks. But there
                                were a few things to fine tune. For instance, a section about the location of the hotel was added
                                (instead of having that information in <em>Hotel Highlights</em>). I organised a new test to
                                validate this new proposition.
                            </p>
                
                            <h4>Re-design and test</h4>
                            <p>In some cases, we also needed design changes, so I discussed possible
                                solutions
                                with the designer and developers, and then
                                tested them with users.
                            </p>

                    <figcaption>Originally, the video (a button in hotel highlight) was too hard too find.
                        Testing showed that users expected the video within the image carousel. But
                        that would have slowed down loading. So instead, we settled on a vignette below the carousel.

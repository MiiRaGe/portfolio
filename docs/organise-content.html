                          <ul>
                              <li>User testing to understand why users cannot find information,</li>
                              <li>Card sorting to find out how users group the content and name the sections, and then used the findings to facilitate discussions around the re-organisation of the content,</li>
                              <li>Tree Testing to evaluate the new content organisation.</li>
                          </ul>

                    <h3>What I did</h3>
        
                    <p>I was part of a multi-disciplinary squad (Analytics, Content, Dev, PM, QA, UX) in charge of the re-design
                        of the product page.</p>

                                <p>I worked with my colleague from the Analytics team to build a good picture of which pieces of
                                    information seemed to cause the most issues, based on data from the customer support teams
                                    and interactions recorded in <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>.

                                <p>The quantitative data allowed to identify a number of issues, but in some cases further
                                    testing was needed to clarify why there were issues. So I conducted remote unmoderated user
                                    testing which showed that:
                                <p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>some content wasn't where users expected it to be.</li>
                                    <li>several section names sounded similar, which made it difficult to know what content to
                                        expect in each section.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>the structure was too deep: after expanding a few subsections without finding what they
                                        were looking for, users just gave up.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>I presented the results to my colleagues in the squad,
                                    and we agreed that we needed to change the way the content of the page was organised.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>A couple of sections of the page weren't actually groups users naturally thought of.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Users chose section names that are more descriptive and shorter than the current
                                        names.

                                <p>I presented these results to the squad. There were some surprises, but we still managed to
                                    agree on a new way to organise
                                    the content that we believed would work better.</p>

                                <p>The results helped
                                    to validate the changes by showing that with the new tree, users can find the information
                                    that was difficult to find before, and it takes them less time to get there.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Content that is organised logically, in sections that reflect what our users are looking for.</li>
                        <li>Section names which are short and describe exactly what each section contains, in our users' own
                            words.
                        </li>
                        <li>A structure which is more flat: only 2 levels of headings.</li>

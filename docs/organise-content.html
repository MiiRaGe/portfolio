                            <h4>Review quantitative data</h4>
                            <p>I worked closely with the Analyst in the team to review data from customer service,
                                and interactions recorded in <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/">Hotjar</a>.

                            <h4>User testing</h4>
                
                            <p>I conducted remote unmoderated user
                                testing on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">Usertesting.com</a> to dig deeper into why some issues
                                occurred. The main takeaways were that:
                            <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>some buttons were hard to discover.</li>
                                <li>some content wasn't where users expected it to be.</li>
                                <li>several section names sounded similar, so it was hard to know what content to
                                    expect in each section.
                                </li>
                                <li>the structure was too deep: after expanding a few subsections without finding what they
                                    were looking for, users just gave up.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                
                            <h4>Workshop</h4>
                            <p>A workshop was led by the Product Owner and Design Lead. I presented an overview of
                                all the issues encountered on the Accommodation page.</p>
                            <p>At the end of the workshop, we had a prioritised list of opportunities to act on. High up the list
                                was re-organising the content on the page, and increasing affordance for key features.</p>

                            <h4>Card Sorting</h4>
                
                            <p>I organised a card sorting exercise on <a href="https://www.optimalworkshop.com/">Optimal Workshop</a> to
                                find out how users naturally group the content
                                and name the sections.</p>
                            <p>The results? A couple of sections of the page weren't groups users naturally thought of, and users chose
                                section names that are more descriptive and shorter than the existing ones.</p>
                            <p>I presented these results to the team. There were surprises, but we managed to
                                agree on a new structure to test. Here are some examples of changes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A lot of content about
                                    activities and food existed as collapsed subsections under a "Your Hotel" section, which we removed.
                                </li>
                                <li>Some sections got merged, like "More Flights Options" and "Your Flight Details" that became "Flights
                                    & Transfers", or "Just for Kids", "Sports and Relaxation" and "Everything else" that became
                                    "Activities".
                                </li>
                                <li>Some sections got different names (e.g. "Swim & Sun" became "Pool & Beach", "What's included in the
                                    packages?" became "Packages", etc.)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                
                            <h4>Tree Testing</h4>
                
                            <p>We needed to validate our proposition before changing thousands of product pages. The tasks in the test
                                were set up using the most frequently asked questions to customer service. There
                                wasn't much buy-in in sister companies in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands: they felt some things
                                would only work in English. So
                                I got help from colleagues there to set up similar tests in German, French and Dutch.</p>
                            <p>The results? In most cases, increased success rate, less hesitation and lower completion times. But there
                                were a few things to fine tune. For instance, a section about the location of the hotel was added
                                (instead of having that information in the general blurb about the hotel). I organised a new test to
                                validate this new proposition.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Re-design and validate</h4>
                            <p>In some cases, design changes were needed in order to fit the new structure. This
                                was for instance the case with the videos of hotels. In those cathat the designe rprototyped and I
                                tested with users.
                            </p>
            </div></div>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <div class="caseParagraphe">
            <h1 class="caseParagrapheTitle">Results</h1>
            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                        <p>With the new structure:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Content is organised in sections that reflect what users are looking for.</li>
                            <li>Section names are short and describe exactly what each section contains, in users' own
                                words.
                            </li>
                            <li>The structure is more flat: 2 levels of headings instead of 4.</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        <p>Changes were gradually rolled out to measure effects. For instance:
                            <ul>
                            <li>Changes around Room Details and Board Type led to an increase of 3.5% in conversions.</li>
                            <li>The new location and design for videos led to an increase of 349% in users engaging with that content
                            (and interacting with the video has the highest associated conversion rate of all
                            clickable elements on the page).</li>
                            </ul>

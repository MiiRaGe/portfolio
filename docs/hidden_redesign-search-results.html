                                            <p>I started by observing a range of users while they looked for their actual holidays on their favourite travel sites.
                                                The research was conducted remotely so I could reach users from different parts of the country without increasing costs.</p>
                                            <p>After this round of research, I showed some typical user journeys and some video clips to the team to demonstrate:</p>

                                                        <li>what information really mattered to decide between different search results,</li>
                                                        <li>what the pain points were on our site, and what worked well on competitors' sites.</li>

                                            <p>Based on this, a UX Designer produced a prototype, and I set up some unmorederated remote tests on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">usertesting.com</a> to validate it.</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The first test focused on the layout:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Participants were asked to find specific information either on the current page or on the prototype.</li>
                                                        <li>This helped to validate that finding information was easier with the new layout.</li>

                                                <li>Later tests focused on the amount of information:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Participants were asked to find a holiday they liked.
                                                        One group was shown a prototype with the same amount of information as on the current page, while another saw a prototype with only the information that we felt was essential.</li>
                                                        <li>Based on the result of these tests, we re-introduced some of the
                                                information we had initially planned to delete.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>

                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>This is an on-going project. The Result Cards have been fully re-designed, and we are now working on the filters.</p>
                        <p>The most important changes so far are that:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The amount of content on each card has been reduced. This was a controversial change, so being able to back up the decisions with research data was very important.</li>
                                        <li>The design of the cards is cleaner, with one column, more white space, and icons. It makes it easier to scan the information.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            <p>The new cards have been a success. When they were A/B tested, we've measured a decrease in the number of product pages users have to visit before making a decision and booking.</p>

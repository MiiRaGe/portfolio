                        <p>When I joined H&M in 2018, a big overhaul of the H&M loyalty program was underway, aiming to increase

                            decrease calls to customer service,

                            <h4>The problem: "Okay... How do I use this?"</h4>
                            <p>Usage of rewards was low. Previous research had shown that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>users had no idea how to use their offers online,</li>
                                <li>staff was spending a lot of time helping customers with rewards in stores.</li>
                            </ul>
                
                            <h4>Design, test, iterate</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The Rewards page</strong> was a big source of confusion and frustration for users: it had a
                                    button to use the offer in store, but just text about how to use it online.
                                    I tested having a button to use in store, but participants were
                                    unsure what to expect when clicking the
                                    new button. I had to tweak the copy and the design
                                    of the confirmation message several times.
                                </li>
                
                                <li><strong>Error messages</strong>: I mapped out error cases with Analyst and Architects. We realised
                                    there were more technical
                                    limitations and complex business
                                    rules than expected: offers that cannot be combined, maximum discount reached, etc.
                                    Providing precise error messages, like I had planned,
                                    would have impacted load times too much in the shopping bag. To balance that out, I made sure
                                    the process was forgiving (offers can be used again if they did not result in discounts).
                
                
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>In store experience</strong>:
                                    Technical limitations kept piling up when we were exploring how to provide an easier experience in
                                    store.
                                    At some point, we had to acknowledge that we had scoped out so much of our solution that
                                    it was not solving any of users' problems anymore. So we made the decision to leave this out
                                    of the release. But we knew the systems
                                    would change soon, so that in the near future we could give it another go!

                        (information icon), and in the worst case scenario, offers are not "burned" after checkout
                        and can be used again if they did not result in discounts.

                            <h4>The brief from business stakeholders</h4>
                            <p>H&M wanted to introduce a new benefit for members: monthly invoices with Klarna. My job was to find how
                                to make that fit into the existing
                                <em>Pay later</em> section under <em>My Account</em>, and to
                                provide helpful reminders when time came to pay the invoices.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Design, test, iterate</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Finding and paying invoices</strong>: The biggest challenge was to fit everything into one
                                    page. My first idea
                                    was to provide two tabs:
                                    one for <em>Pay in XX days</em>, and the other one for <em>Monthly invoices</em>. But it became
                                    clear
                                    in user testing that the distinction between the two methods was irrelevant to users.
                                    What matters: what still needs to be paid, and what has already been paid.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Notifications</strong>: To encourage customers to pay in time, from the H&M app (not from
                                    the Klarna app), it had been decided that we would send push notifications about due invoices.
                                    The problem? H&M
                                    already sent a lot of notifications! <!--Research suggested few new users would turn on push
                                    notifications unless we allowed them to choose what to opt-in for, and for those who did receive
                                    notifications, reminders to pay invoices would be lost among marketing messages.-->
                                    I tried to push to send less notifications overall, and to allow users to choose what types of
                                    messages to opt-in for. But
                                    I did not manage to get all stakeholders to agree in time for that release. We did however
                                    launch
                                    a wider initiative around the quality and quantity of our communications to customers.
                                    And for that release, I focused on highlighting things to pay within the interface instead, for
                                    instance through badges and
                                    an inbox for personal
                                    communications in <em>My Account</em>.

                        Main changes: the 2 tabs changed from <em>Individual
                            invoices</em> and <em>Monthly invoices</em> to <em>To pay</em> and <em>All purchases</em> and
                        Invoices for each month are not displayed on a separate view anymore.

                                Part of the problem is that a lot of "Rewards" are actually news and not offers:
                                the template is used in ways I had not foreseen. This could have been avoided with better
                                communication with Loyalty managers and content creators.

                                not differentiate between <em>Monthly invoice</em> and <em>Pay in XX days</em>, and tracking the
                                impact of <em>Pay Later</em> under <em>My account</em> has not been a priority.

                        <p>When I joined H&M in 2018, a big overhaul of the H&M loyalty program was underway, aiming to increase

                            decrease calls to customer service,

            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                        <p>We were working in a waterfall environment, and when I joined H&M, discovery, requirements and analysis had
                            already been completed.</p>
                
                        <p>For each case, I started by getting to know
                            my colleagues and familiarising myself with the work done previously. Then, the process was to:</p>

                            <h4>The problem: "Okay... How do I use this?"</h4>
                            <p>Usage of rewards was low. Previous research had shown that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>users had no idea how to use their offers online,</li>
                                <li>staff was spending a lot of time helping customers with rewards in stores.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>So, it had been decided to re-design the Rewards page, and to explore how we might make
                                the processes of redeeming rewards simpler.
                            </p>
                
                            <h4>Design, test, iterate</h4>
                            <p>The Rewards page was a big source of confusion and frustration for users: it had a clear
                                button to use the offer in store, but only text about how to use it online.</p>
                            <p>I tested having a button to use in store. But in the first rounds of user testing, participants were
                                unsure what to expect when clicking the
                                new button. I had to tweak the copy and the design
                                of the confirmation message several times.</p>
                
                            <h4>Error cases</h4>
                            <p>While I explored
                                all the possible scenarios with Analyst and Architects, we realised that there were more technical
                                limitations and complicated business
                                rules than expected.
                                I had to change how I had initially planned to provide feedback to users to balance:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>being forgiving and providing precise error messages,</li>
                                <li>avoiding making too many calls to the systems powering the rewards, so as to not increase
                                    the load times too much.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>In store experience</h4>
                            <p>Technical limitations kept piling up when we were exploring how to provide an easier experience in store.
                                At some point, we had to acknowledge that we had scoped out so much of our solution that
                                it was not solving any of users' problems anymore. So we made the decision to leave this out
                                of the release. But we knew the systems
                                would change soon, so that in the near future we could give it another go!</p>

                            <h4>The brief from business stakeholders</h4>
                            <p>In some markets, H&M was to start rolling out invoices through
                                Klarna, replacing other invoices methods. My job was to find how to make that fit into the existing
                                H&MxKlarna pages (containing the purchases made with the "Pay in XX days with Klarna" payment method),
                                and to
                                provide helpful reminders when time came to pay the invoices.
                            </p>
                            <h4>Finding and paying invoices</h4>
                            <p>The biggest challenge was that a lot of information and actions had to fit into one page. My first idea
                                was to provide 2 tabs:
                                one for "Pay in XX days", and the other one for Monthly invoices. But after gaining more understanding
                                of how those payment methods work, and conducting some user tests, I settled on another layout: one tab
                                for what was still to pay (all payment methods), and another for what had already been paid.</p>
                
                            <h4>Notifications</h4>
                            <p>It had been decided on the business side that H&M would send push notifications about invoices.
                                It was an effort to be helpful to customers. But there was also
                                potential to have a negative impact, which I tried to minimize.
                            </p>
                            <p>I proposed to allow customers to choose which type of notifications they would receive from H&M,
                                so they would be more in control. But as complexity increased, that ended up being de-scoped, with a
                                promise to look into
                                it again as part of a wider project to limit communications to customers.</p>
                            <p>Without a way to choose the type of notifications received, data suggested fewer users would turn on push
                                notifications.
                                So I focused on highlighting things to pay within the interface instead, for instance through badges and
                                an inbox for personal
                                communications in the My account pages.</p>

                        <p>In the first month after launch, we saw:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1 million new members</strong> signed up.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>a reduction in the number of conversation with customers service</strong>
                                (7% of all contacts, down from 10%).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>increased used of rewards</strong> (+14% in the part of members using rewards every time they shop).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>One disappointment was that
                            we observed no increase in the perceived usefulness or relevance of rewards.
                            Part of the problem is that a lot of "Rewards" are actually news and not offers:
                            the template is used in ways I had not foreseen. This could have been avoided with better
                            communication with Loyalty managers and content creators.

                        <p>When I joined H&M in 2018, a big overhaul of the H&M loyalty program had been decided. The main goals?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>increase engagement, increase member satisfaction and decrease rewards debt.</li>
                            <li>decrease calls to customer service, to reduce costs.</li>
                            <li>increase sign ups (not a goal I directly worked with).</li>

                        </p>
                        <p>We were working in a waterfall environment, and when I joined H&M, discovery, requirements and analysis had already been completed. With development outsourced,
                            throughout discussions during the Design phase and impeccable design deliverables were key.</p>

                        <p>For each case, I started by getting to know
                            my colleagues and familiarising myself with the work done previously. Then, the process was to:

                        <h4>The problem</h4>
                        <p>Usage of rewards was low. Previous research suggested to explore
                            how we might:
                            <ul>
                            <li>allow to apply offers earlier in the journey, on the Rewards page and the Shopping bag page (instead of just at the last stage of checkout).</li>
                            <li>make the process easier to understand in store.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Online experience, from the Rewards page</h4>
                        <p>I prototyped, user tested, and iterated this part of the experience multiple times.
                        The main challenge was to provide a good confirmation that the offer had indeed been added to the bag.
                
                        </p>
                        <h4>Online experience, from the Shopping bag page</h4>
                        <p>While I explored
                        all the possible scenarios with Analyst and Architects, we realised that there were more technical limitations and complicated business
                            rules than expected.
                        I had to change my designs, and find a balance between:
                            <ul>
                            <li>being forgiving and providing precise error messages,</li>
                            <li>avoiding making too many calls to the systems powering the rewards, so as to not increase
                                the load times too much.</li></ul></p>
                        <h4>In store experience</h4>
                        <p>Technical limitations kept piling up when we were exploring how to provide an easier experience in store.
                        At some point, we had to acknowledge that we had scoped out so much of our solution that
                        it was not solving any of users' problems anymore. So we made the decision to leave this out
                        of the release, and continue relying on store staff to help customers for now. But we knew the systems
                            would change soon, so that in the near future we could give it another go!</p>

                        <h4>The problem</h4>
                        <p>This was a last minute addition to the scope. In some markets, H&M was to start rolling out invoices through
                            Klarna, replacing other invoices methods. My job was to find how to make that fit into the existing
                            H&MxKlarna pages (containing the purchases made with the "Pay in XX days with Klarna" payment method), and to
                            provide helpful reminders when time came to pay the invoices.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Finding and paying invoices</h4>
                        <p>The biggest challenge was that a lot of information and actions had to fit into one page. My first idea was to provide 2 tabs:
                        one for "Pay in XX days", and the other one for Monthly invoices. But after gaining more understanding
                        of how those payment methods work, and conducting some user tests, I settled on another layout: one tab
                        for what was still to pay (all payment methods), and another for what had already been paid.</p>
                        <h4>Notifications</h4>
                        <p>It had been decided on the business side that H&M would send push notifications about invoices.
                        It was an effort to be helpful to customers. But there was also
                            potential to have a negative impact, which I tried to minimize.
                        </p>
                        <p>I proposed to allow customers to choose which type of notifications they would receive from H&M,
                        so they would be more in control. But as complexity increased, that ended up being de-scoped, with a promise to look into
                        it again as part of a wider project to limit communications to customers.</p>
                        <p>Without a way to choose the type of notifications received, data suggested fewer users would turn on push notifications.
                        So I focused on highlighting things to pay within the interface instead, for instance through badges and an inbox for personal
                            communications in the My account pages.</p>

            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                    <p>The re-design, along with heavy marketing campaigns and gradual launch in new countries led to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 million new members in the first month after launch, and a member base that had doubled after 9
                            months.
                        </li>
                        <li>a reduction in the number of conversation with customers service. In the first month after launch,
                            membership-related queries accounted for about 7% of contacts, down from 9%.
                        </li>
                        <li>an increase of 14% in the part of members using rewards every time they shop.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But some things did not go as well as expected.
                        For instance,
                        we observed no increase in the perceived usefulness or relevance of rewards.
                        A big part of the problem is that the Rewards template is being used in ways I had not forseen: some rewards
                        lack key CTAs, and other "rewards" are actually just
                        communications about H&M.
                        Before launch, I had held a training session with AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) users to explain the
                        new rewards layout and how to use it, but it wasn't enough. A good learning for me.

                        <p>I grew up in a small town in the North East of France, close to <strong>Strasbourg</strong>.
                            I studied <strong>Software Engineering</strong> <a href="https://www.telecom-sudparis.eu/">in Paris</a> and
                            <strong>Human-Computer-Interaction</strong> <a href="https://www.bth.se/eng/">in Karlkrona</a> (yep, that's
                            the start of my story with Sweden!).</p>
                        <p>I’ve worked in <strong>Nice, London and Stockholm</strong>, more recently at <a
                                href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/index.html">H&M</a>. Before that, I was at Travel company <a

            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                        <p>Honestly, I don't like talking about myself all that much (wow, that's original!). Writing out some blurb
                            about all
                            my supposed qualities makes me suuuuper uncomfortable. How would you even know if it's true?
                        </p>
                        <p>I've been following <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/the-science-of-well-being">a course about the
                            science of well-being</a> and one assignment was to fill in this <a
                                href="https://www.viacharacter.org/character-strengths-via">quiz to find out your character
                            strengths</a>... So I thought,
                            hey, that's probably a more objective view! So voilà, here they are, my top strengths:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Humility</li>
                            <li>Judgement</li>
                            <li>Perspective</li>
                            <li>Kindness</li>
                            <li>Appreciation of beauty and elegance</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>My colleagues usually describe me as kind, honest, wise, and a great source for feedback.</p>

                        <p>Making stuff that bring value to people's life, and work for all people.</p>
                        <p>My background is in science, so of course I'm pretty obsessed about research and data, and making sure we have a good understanding of the
                        problem we're trying to solve.</p>
                        <p>I also care deeply about accessibility. At first, just because it obviously is the right
                        thing to do, and because of a few people close to me. But I became even more driven when
                            I started running accessibility testing, as I came to realise how much I still had to learn, and started to understand
                            the true extent of the misery some careless design decisions
                            can unleash.

                            <li>Spending time with my husband Alexis and my 18 months old son Nolan,</li>
                            <li>Playing board games with friends. My favourite type of game? A lot of strategy, some collaboration, and
                                no place for luck!

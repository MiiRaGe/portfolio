                                <li>Are there issues stopping users from signing up?</li>
                                <li>Can users find where to sign up? Are we promoting sign up right?</li>
                                <li>Are there market specificities we should be aware of?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Methodologies used</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Click tests on <a href="https://www.userzoom.com/">Userzoom</a>.</li>
                                <li>Usability testing.</li>
                                <li>Previous in-house research into local experiences.
                                </li>
                                <li>Quantitative data from <a
                                        href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> and

                            <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>No need to go too heavy on the Sign ups CTAs. Users can find it already, and it's getting a bit too
                                    much.</li>
                                <li>We are not always promoting sign up in the right context, and users
                                    sometimes find the copy uninspiring.
                                </li>
                                <li>Drop out rates on mobile (which accounts for 70% of H&M's visitors) is 30% higher than on desktop:
                                    no wonder, when it takes 40s longer to sign up, and there's severe usability issues (especially on
                                    Android).
                                </li>
                                <li>In some countries, we must provide more sign-up options.

                            I did a quick showcase of the research at our Sprint Demo to help our stakeholders

                            <p>The date of birth was by far the biggest drop off point in the sign up form.
                            </p>

                                <li><strong>Stop to require the date of birth:</strong>
                                    The Product Owner and I started discussions with our stakeholders:
                                    Why do we need the date of birth? How else can we collect it? I prototyped
                                    a few ideas to help kickstart things.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Change the input method</strong>: with a precise date so far back in the past, a calendar
                                    (Android) or a
                                    scrollable list (iOS) are not the most appropriate. I reviewed existing research and guidelines
                                    (like
                                    <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/#asking-for-memorable-dates">Research
                                        by gov.uk</a> and <a href="https://material.io/components/date-pickers#mobile-pickers">Material
                                        Design</a>) and sketched out two ideas.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Design review</h4>
                            <p>I took the ideas to our daily Design Review.
                                We decided on the solution that allowed to stick to existing components in our Design System: simple
                                input, split in 3 fields (day, month, year), with
                                one visible label.</p>
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p><strong>Drop outs and time to complete the form decreased.</strong>
                                And the rate of errors when filling in the form did not significantly change like we could have
                                feared. </p>
                            <p>The next things to look at to reduce friction? Unclear password rules and error messages.</p>

                            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
                            <p>Promoting sign up in the checkout is where it makes the most sense for users: they get
                                immediate benefits from it (like free shipping and
                                discounts). And user testing pointed to some easy improvements, like tweaking the copy.</p>
                            <h4>Ideation Workshop</h4>
                            <p>I invited business experts,
                                designers, product owners and analysts from Loyalty and Checkout teams to a workshop to generate ideas
                                together.
                                The workshop was very appreciated, as it brought together people who were not often in the
                                same room, or didn’t feel involved in design decisions.</p>

                            <p>We generated a prioritised list of ideas to A/B test. The first one was to
                                change the labels on the CTAs to continue to checkout, and it performed well.</p>

                                social sign up is preferred
                                (I won't reveal details or show designs as the launch is still confidential).</p>
                            <h4>Understand the market and the platform</h4>
                            <p>I did some reading to understand the market better.
                                And we met with our colleagues in that market to share knowledge and build a closer
                                relationship.</p>

                            <p>I worked closely with our IT Architect and Developers to understand technical limitations
                                and draw up user flows where all scenarios are accounted for.
                                I had to make assumptions about
                                what would be the most user-friendly solutions, but was hoping to be able to test those soon.

                            <h4>Sketch, Design Review, Prototype</h4>
                            <p>I sketched out different ideas for a layout to accommodate extra sign up options and extra legal text. I selected three
                                thanks to feedback received in Design Review, then prepared prototypes for user test.</p>
                            <h4>Test and Adjust</h4>
                            <p>In user testing, I observed that one layout resulted in less errors than the others. However, no clear
                                insights emerged around some of the tricky points in the journey, like signing up directly from the
                                social
                                media platform. This was likely because to gain time and reduce costs, I had to compromise
                                in recruitment: participants were from the market, but based in the US.

                        <p>After 4 months in the team, I had to join another team (due to cut hours with the Covid-19 situation). When I left, they thanked me for helping them to become more user-centered, more data-driven, and more
                            confident in prioritising their backlog and handling stakeholders.</p>

                                <li>Are there issues stopping users from signing up?</li>
                                <li>Can users find where to sign up? Are we promoting sign up right?</li>
                                <li>Are there market specificities we should be aware of?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Methodologies used</h4>
                            <ul>

                                <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Previous in-house research</strong> into local experiences.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Quantitative data</strong> from <a

                            <h4>Key takeaways</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>In what context we promote sign up and which benefits we put forward</strong> needs some
                                    work. We don't need to put Sign ups CTAs everywhere, users can find it already, and it's getting a
                                    bit too
                                    much.
                                    But, we are not doing enough at the checkout, and the copy tends to be uninspiring.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>The drop out rate on mobile is 30% higher than on desktop</strong>:
                                    no wonder, when it takes 40s longer to sign up, and there's severe usability issues on Android.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>More sign-up options is a must</strong>, especially in some key markets.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Based on those insights, we established our priority. Then,
                                I did a quick showcase of the research at our Sprint Demo to help our stakeholders
                                understand the decisions.</p>

                            <p>The date of birth was by far the biggest drop off point in the sign up form.
                            </p>

                                <li><strong>Stop to require the date of birth:</strong>
                                    The Product Owner and I started discussions with key stakeholders:
                                    Why do we need the date of birth? How else can we collect it? I prototyped
                                    a few ideas to help kickstart things.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Change the input method</strong>: with a precise date so far back in the past, a calendar
                                    (Android) or a
                                    scrollable list (iOS) are not the most appropriate. I reviewed existing research and guidelines
                                    (like
                                    <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/dates/#asking-for-memorable-dates">Research
                                        by gov.uk</a> and <a href="https://material.io/components/date-pickers#mobile-pickers">Material
                                        Design</a>) and sketched out two ideas.

                            </ul>
                
                            <p><strong>Feeback in Design Review</strong> helped me to pick the
                                solution that allowed to stick to existing components in our Design System: three simple
                                input fields, with
                                one visible label.</p>
                            <h4>Results</h4>
                            <p><strong>Drop outs and time to complete the form decreased.</strong>
                                And the rate of errors when filling in the form did not significantly change like we could have
                                feared. </p>

                            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
                            <p>Promoting sign up in the checkout is where it makes the most sense for users: they get
                                immediate benefits from it (like free shipping and
                                discounts). And user testing pointed to some easy improvements, like tweaking the copy.</p>

                            <p>I invited business experts,
                                designers, product owners and analysts from Loyalty and Checkout teams to a workshop to generate ideas
                                together.
                                The workshop was very appreciated, as it brought together people who were not often in the
                                same room, or didn’t feel involved in design decisions.</p>

                            <h4>Opportunity</h4>
                            <p>The membership was about to launch in Korea, where email usage is low, and most people are users of the
                                social media platform KakaoTalk.</p>
                            <h4>Competitive analysis</h4>
                            <p>I did some reading to understand the market better, and got help from local colleagues to examine how
                                competitors tied their loyalty programs to
                                Kakao.</p>
                            <h4>User flows & new layout</h4>
                            <p>I worked closely with our IT Architect and Developers to draw up user flows. There were a lot of
                                scenarios to account for, and it was a real challenge to keep the experience frictionless within the
                                limits of our own systems and Kakao's Login API.
                            </p>
                            <p>I sketched out the main flows and different layout possibilities for the sign up form. I
                                selected 3
                                based on feedback in Design Review, then prepared prototypes to test.</p>
                            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
                            <p>One layout resulted in less errors than the others. However, no clear
                                insights emerged around some of the tricky points in the journey, like signing up directly from the
                                Kakao App, or merging accounts if the email address is already in our systems. But it was expected:
                                to gain time and reduce costs, I had to compromise
                                in recruitment, and participants were Kakao users based in the US.

                <h3>What I did</h3>
    
                <div id="research-steps">
                    <p>I worked with two other consultants who were respectively in charge of the research and visual
                        design, while
                        I was in charge of UX design and interaction design.</p>

                        <div class="stepDetails">
                            <p>The first step was to familiarise myself with the technical documentation and meet with the
                                key stakeholders,
                                while my colleague went on site to observe users of the product we were re-designing and
                                users of its competitor.
                                This allowed us to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>gauge which elements were the most important to allow operators to make decisions.</li>
                                <li>understand what kind of challenges users faced due to the environment in which they
                                    work.
                                </li>
                                <li>identify strengths and weaknesses in the market to prioritise changes.</li>

                        <div class="stepDetails">
                            <p>I conducted an ideation workshop with the key stakeholders. This allowed us to make sure
                                everyone felt involved in the design process (and excited about it!). By the end, we had
                                collaboratively outlined the key journeys, agreed on how information should be prioritised,
                                and produced paper sketches illustrating
                                concurrent ideas.</p>

                            <p>I created a series of wireframes that allowed to visualise the new flow and layout of the
                                pages,
                                then iterated a couple of times to address
                                any concerns that stakeholder might have had regarding technical limitations.</p>

                            <p>Our visual designer created high-fidelity visualisations
                                based on the wireframes, as well as a new set of icons for the interface.</p>
                            <p>We then worked together on a document summing up how to implement the
                                new layout and explaining the interactions.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number of steps required to complete a roll inspection have been reduced by focusing
                        on what operators really need to make decisions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Actionnable elements are bigger so they can be activated even when wearing gloves.</li>

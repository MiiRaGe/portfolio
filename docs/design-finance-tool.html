            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                        <p><a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en">The Money Advice Service</a> was commissioned by the UK
                            Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to build
                            <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/money-manager">a tool</a>
                            offering
                            financial advice to people claiming the new Universal Credit benefits.<p>
                        <p>The original idea (an online course) was not well received: it did not answer users' main questions, and was
                            perceived as kind of insulting. So, Money Advice Service decided to start from scratch.
                            With only two months left before the agreed launch date and no available UX designers, they brought me in
                            (as a UX Consultant from System Concepts).

                        <p>I worked closely with a Project Manager and a Copywriter from the Money Advice Service,
                            a Researcher and senior representatives of the DWP, and developers from the agency in charge of

                            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                
                            <p>We needed to gain a
                                better understanding of our target audience.
                                I joined our Researcher as a note taker, while he conducted interviews at Job Centres.
                                We focused on uncovering how our users managed their money and what their pain points
                                were with the new Universal Credit benefits system.</p>
                            <h4>Workshops</h4>
                
                            <p>I held a series of workshops to collectively digest the findings from the interviews
                                and define user needs, personas and user journeys.
                                People had many negative assumptions about our users, and it was tough to get them to
                                empathise. So the researcher and I had to work hard on making the stories we brought back from
                                the interviews relatable, by including lots of details.</p>
                            <p>We often got trapped in
                                discussions related to the "old" prototype that people were very attached to. Some of those
                                discussion could easily be parked. But at other times, it was necessary for me to deviate from
                                my perfectly-planned workshop agenda, talk things through and come up with different exercises on the
                                spot
                                to get us back on track to our end goal.
                            </p>
                
                
                            <h4>Personas, User Needs & User Journeys</h4>
                
                            <p>Based on outcomes from the workshops, I finalised a list of user needs, personas and user journeys.
                
                                Having these materials was useful later on to inform the design and the content creation.

                        <br>Based on the needs,
                        we outlined what content was needed on site at each stage of the Universal Credit journey, and drew up a
                        draft IA. Extra content was requested from
                        senior stakeholders at the DWP (this is identified in a different colour in the deliverables,
                        to help us remember it doesn't come from research and has to be validated.)

                                <p>Based on the insights from the discovery phase, I produced sketches, and
                                    then low-fidelity wireframes in Axure.
                                    These were regularly shared with stakeholders, taken out for guerrilla testing and updated.

                                <p>In parallel, I was heavily involved in reviewing the copy produced for the different
                                    sections of the site. The copy was tested with red and green pen exercises in Job Centers.</p>

                                    When copy was ready and we were satisfied that the design was going in the right direction, I
                                    created a
                                    higher

                                    prototype for longer testing sessions in the lab.

                                that was too
                                much to interact with! <br>It then turned into a one-page questionnaire that felt too
                                overwhelming, and finally
                                into a quiz divided in 11 steps.
                                Copy was adjusted along the way too.

                            <p>Help make the quality management tool provided by <a href="https://www.crownpeak.com/">Crownpeak</a> more user-friendly for both:</p>

                            <p>For this project, I worked with another UX Consultant.</p>

                                            <p>The first step was to run remote user testing with participants from all around the world,
                                                who were employees of companies who use Crownpeak's tool.</p>
                                            <p>The goal was to understand how different user types were using the tool and identify usability issues.
                                            We then lead discussion with the product team to decide what should be prioritised.</p>

                                            <p>Based on this, a UX Designer produced a prototype, and I set up some unmorederated remote tests on <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">usertesting.com</a> to validate it.</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The first test focused on the layout:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Participants were asked to find specific information either on the current page or on the prototype.</li>
                                                        <li>This helped to validate that finding information was easier with the new layout.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Later tests focused on the amount of information:
                                                    <ul>
                                                        <li>Participants were asked to find a holiday they liked.
                                                        One group was shown a prototype with the same amount of information as on the current page, while another saw a prototype with only the information that we felt was essential.</li>
                                                        <li>Based on the result of these tests, we re-introduced some of the
                                                information we had initially planned to delete.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                </li>
                                            </ul>

                        <h3>Results</h3>
                        <p>This is an on-going project. The Result Cards have been fully re-designed, and we are now working on the filters.</p>
                        <p>The most important changes so far are that:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The amount of content on each card has been reduced. This was a controversial change, so being able to back up the decisions with research data was very important.</li>
                                        <li>The design of the cards is cleaner, with one column, more white space, and icons. It makes it easier to scan the information.</li>
                                    </ul>
                            <p>The new cards have been a success. When they were A/B tested, we've measured a decrease in the number of product pages users have to visit before making a decision and booking.</p>

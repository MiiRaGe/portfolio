            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                        <p>New laws in the US, coming into effect in 2015, meant that all airlines flying to and from the US were
                            scrambling to
                            make their website more compliant with level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0
                            (WCAG 2.0).
                        </p>
                        <p>I have worked to achieve this goal as an intern at <a href="https://amadeus.com/en">Amadeus</a> (technology
                            for the
                            travel industry) on the

                            which is used by over a hundred airlines, and later with airlines such as Japan
                            Airlines, Avianca, Egyptair or China Southern Airlines, as a UX Consultant at <a

            <h2 class="caseParagrapheTitle">The process</h2>
            <div class="caseParagrapheContent">
                        <p>I usually advised to start with an audit and fix the biggest issues before moving on to
                            conduct accessibility testing. This was to ensure that the testing sessions
                            would not be too difficult, with participants being stuck from the very first page.</p>
                        <p>Watching the testing sessions often makes the teams very motivated to deliver more accessible
                            products. Training sessions that go beyond guidelines are a good way to build up on this.

                            <p>I have conducted multiple audits, mostly for booking and check-in journeys, but also
                                for other content like customer service pages. When conducting the audits,
                                I examine the pages with:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>common assistive technologies (such as the screen reader JAWS),</li>
                                <li>specific accessibility settings (like inverted colors),</li>
                                <li>tools like the Web Developper browser extension.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Then, when necessary, I dive into the code of the pages to pin-point what causes
                                the issues and how to fix them.</p>
                            <p>When I first started working with Amadeus,
                                there were problems
                                that would completely shut out some users from airline websites (for instance,
                                completely impossible to select a flight with a keyboard, or a structure
                                so chaotic that it was impossible to make sense of the content when listening
                                with a screen reader). I've had the pleasure of
                                seeing this evolve over time. And it has been quite interesting to observe how personalisation for all
                                the different
                                airlines (who use the same booking and check-in interface from Amadeus) could impact the overall
                                accessibility.</p>

                            <p>When preparing test scripts, I made sure to allow extra time. And when participants

                                and explain them during the session, so everyone could see first hand the different ways
                                these tools can be used.
